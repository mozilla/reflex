  into state changes.

    /**
    Function takes stream of state changes for the component it's responsible
    for and applies them by writing. As a return value it returns steam of
    changes caused by component it's responsible for in equivalent structure
    as reads.

    Given state `changes` must be a stream of data structures in a following
    format:

    Change 1:

        {
          "item-1": { "text": "foo", "completion": true }
        }

    Change 2:

        {
          "item-2": null
        }

    Change 3:

        {
          "item-3": { "text": "bar" }
        }

    It's always a `hash` where keys are unique identifiers for the nested
    components and values are deltas that must be applied to a components
    state. Each attribute of the value describes new state of the associated
    field, in the change 1 `text` field of the component with an id
    `item-1` has changed to `"foo"` while it's `completion` field has changed
    to `true`. In change 2 nested `item-2` is deleted entirely. In the change 3
    `text` field for the `item-3` has changed to `"bar"`.

    Also note that given example assumes nested components, but that does not
    necessary needs to be the case. If component represents simple UI widget
    like text field it will just get stream of updates with a same identifier:

    Change 1:

        { "text": "Hello" }

    Change 2:

        { "text": "world" }
