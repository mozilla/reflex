  /**
  Function takes overlay `mapping` that is `id` mapped to a function value
  responsible for computing a value for that id. Each function will be used
  to perform a reductions over a stream of state updates. In return they
  supposed to compute value for the given `id`. In return this function
  returns a function which given a stream of state changes will return
  equivalent stream of changes but with a computed properties added.
  This allows adding computed fields to a state model so that units and
  components could use them as regular state attributes. Also note that
  resulting stream will only contain changes to the computed properties
  if they actually changed.

  ## Example

      var foo = overlay({
        count: function(previous, current) {
            var items = current.items
            var ids = Object.keys(items)
            var completed = ids.map(function(id) {
              return items[id]
            }).filter(function(item) {
              return item.completed
            }).length

            return {
              all: items.count,
              completed: completed,
              pending: count - completed
            }
